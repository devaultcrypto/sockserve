## What is Sockserve?

Sockserve is a frontend API for Bitd that provides a streaming output of new transactions. Unlike [Bitserve](https://github.com/devaultcrypto/bitserve) which is a similar frontend API used to fetch historical blockchain data, Sockserve can be used display data as it comes in.
